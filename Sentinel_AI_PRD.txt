PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

Product Name: Sentinel AI Autonomous Authorization Integrity &
Continuous Security Intelligence Platform

1.  Executive Summary

Sentinel AI is a multi-agent AI security platform designed to detect,
validate, and continuously test authentication and authorization
vulnerabilities in Python backend systems.

Unlike traditional security scanners that rely on static pattern
matching or external penetration testing, Sentinel AI:

-   Models authorization logic as a system
-   Detects privilege escalation paths
-   Identifies silent permission drift during refactors
-   Runs continuous internal adversarial simulations
-   Reduces false positives through layered AI validation

The platform operates across the software lifecycle:

1.  Development-Time Intelligence (CI/CD)
2.  Production-Time Autonomous Red Team

Sentinel AI functions as:

-   GitHub Copilot for authorization security
-   Continuous internal red-team engineer
-   Authorization graph monitoring system

2.  Problem Statement

Modern backend systems suffer from:

-   Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
-   Privilege escalation paths
-   Missing role guards
-   Refactor-induced permission drift
-   IDOR vulnerabilities
-   Inconsistent middleware enforcement

Existing tools:

-   Focus on pattern-based scanning
-   Lack contextual role reasoning
-   Do not model authorization relationships
-   Produce high false positives
-   Do not detect version-to-version permission drift

There is no system that:

-   Continuously models authorization as a graph
-   Detects silent permission changes
-   Simulates adversarial access in production safely
-   Explains vulnerabilities in engineering language

3.  Product Vision

Sentinel AI will become the industry-standard platform for authorization
integrity.

Core Vision:

Authorization should be continuously modeled, validated, and
adversarially tested — not assumed correct.

15. Strategic Moat

Sentinel AI is defensible because:

-   Authorization Graph Modeling
-   Continuous Drift Detection
-   Internal Autonomous Adversarial Agent
-   Multi-layer AI validation reducing noise
-   Python-first deep contextual modeling

Most tools scan patterns. Sentinel models system logic.

16. Open Questions

-   UX approach for graph visualization?
-   Multi-tenant architecture design?
-   Secure GitHub App onboarding flow?
-   Enterprise pricing model?
-   SLA expectations?
-   On-prem deployment option?

Validation Engine - GitHub integration - Dashboard MVP

Phase 2 (6–8 weeks): - Production adversarial agent - Drift timeline
engine - Advanced scoring

Final Positioning Statement

Sentinel AI is the first system that continuously models, validates, and
adversarially tests authorization logic as a living security system —
not a static checklist.
